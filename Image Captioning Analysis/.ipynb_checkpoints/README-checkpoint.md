# 🖼️ Image Captioning Web App

An interactive **image captioning web application** built with **Streamlit** and powered by the **BLIP (Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training)** vision–language model.  
The app generates natural language descriptions for user-uploaded images and allows real-time experimentation with text generation parameters.

## 🚀 Live Application

The application is publicly available and deployed on **Streamlit Community Cloud**:

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project explores the intersection of **computer vision** and **natural language processing** by leveraging a pre-trained multimodal transformer model.  
Users can upload an image and instantly receive one or more descriptive captions generated by the model.

Beyond basic captioning, the application allows users to:
- Control randomness and creativity
- Adjust output length
- Generate multiple caption variants
- Guide the caption generation with an optional text prompt

The goal is to provide a simple yet powerful playground for experimenting with vision–language models.
